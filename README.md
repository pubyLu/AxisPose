### Environment
To set up the required environment, run the following commandsï¼š
```
pip install -r requirment.txt
```

### Model Inference
We use GPU A100-40G with CUDA 12.2 to train and test our model. To sample our pretrained model, run the following commands:
```
python main.py --config {DATASET}.yml --exp {PROJECT_PATH} --doc {MODEL_NAME} --sample --fid --timesteps 1000 --eta 0 --ni
```
where 
- `STEPS` controls how many timesteps used in the process.
- `MODEL_NAME` finds the pre-trained checkpoint according to its inferred path.

We provide a pretrained model and some test images ([here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1vHRCJRdTW4xTADf5x-PikQ?pwd=i68v)) for evaluation. Note: Put the checkpoint file under "./weight/", and put test images (RGB & Mask) under "./sample/".
